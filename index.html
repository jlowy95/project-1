        <h4>Motivations and Hypothesis</h4>
        <p>
            We were interested in uncovering demographic trends and other unexpected phenomena among narcotics users, which is difficult given many attempts to be secretive about such activity.  We were specifically curious about the following:
            What age groups and ethnicities of narcotics users may be more prone to accidental overdose or other lethal incidents?  
            Contamination among illegal narcotics is said to be on the rise; does our data support this as a possibility?  Accordingly, which drugs appear to be the most lethal (cause the most deaths)?  How are these narcotics taken: by themselves, with other drugs?
            When do these accidents occur?  Are they confined to certain parts of the week or month?
            Are these deaths concentrated in urban/populated regions?  Are certain narcotics found to be more popular/prevalent in specific areas?

        <h4>Methods</h4>
        <p>
            The data used in this analysis is limited to the data from the state of Connecticut (Accidental drug related deaths 2012 - 2018). The data is collected from the investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death date, address of the victim, and etc.
            Python, Jupyter, and Pandas were the primary tools used for preparing our findings.  The Google API  in combination with Jupyter Gmaps was used for visualization and mapping of our results.
